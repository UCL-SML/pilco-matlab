PILCO Software Package V0.9 (2013-07-04)

I. Introduction
This software package implements the PILCO RL policy search framework. The learning framework can be applied to MDPs with continuous states and controls/actions and is based on probabilistic modeling of the dynamics and approximate Bayesian inference for policy evaluation and improvement.



II. Quick Start
We have already implemented some scenarios that can be found in
<PILCO-ROOT>/scenarios .

If you want to get started immediately, go to 
<PILCO-ROOT>/scenarios/cartPole

and execute

cartPole_learn



III. Documentation
A detailed documentation can be found in

<PILCO-ROOT>/doc/doc.pdf

which also includes a description of how to set up your own scenario (there are only a few files that are scenario specific). 



IV. Contact
